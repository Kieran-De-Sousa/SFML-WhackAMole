# SFML-WhackAMole
Whack-A-Mole was my introduction to using the SFML library in C++; with this project there was a lot of learning into game states and game code structuring. My knowledge of the SFML library and C++ improved with this project, with a particular focus on getting adequated with the libraries features along with presenting a playable game to illustrate this.
